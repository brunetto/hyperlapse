hyperlapse
==========

Small program to create hyperlapses with Google Street View.

My homemade hyperlapse tool inspired by [http://hyperlapse.tllabs.io/](http://hyperlapse.tllabs.io/).    
It will download (using 4 "threads") the StreetView images corresponding to the data in test.dat and create the gif hyperlapse.

### Installation

If you have a Go installation you can install `hyperlapse` with

````bash
go get github.com/brunetto/hyperlapse
````

otherwise you can just download the binary (for linux)  [here](https://github.com/brunetto/hyperlapse/blob/master/hyperlapse)

### Use

Prepare a table with a list of "step" in the format

```
latitute, longitude, size, field of view, (direction of) head(ing), pitch
```

for example

```
40.720032,-73.988354, 400, 90, 90, 0
```

This results in [this](https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/streetview?size=400x400&location=40.720032,-73.988354&fov=90&heading=90&pitch=0) frame.

Run it with 

`````bash
./hyperlapse test.dat
````

### Note

The test.dat file contains only one coordinate copied over multiple lines so it will download multiple copies of the same image.

### TODO

* ~~Automatically create the gif file with the images.]~~ `done`
* Automatically create the list of coordinates given the path
